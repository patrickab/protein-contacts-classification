Welcome to the **Protein Contacts Classification** project. 
Since we work with large files, we suggest using **Google Drive** for data management. 
All paths are set up to function without any modifications, assuming the "SB_project" folder is located in user's personal My Drive.

You can access the project folder here: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rlt2uXVaTYw9wyAlFcMnk5RhaQlEtr53?usp=sharing).

## New Features Calculation 🔍

All necessary information can be found in the notebook **`new_features.ipynb`**. The final result is stored as an updated dataset in the directory mentioned above, available in two formats:
- **`df_new.csv`**
- **`df_new.pkl`**

If other files are referenced in the notebook, such as PDB files, they are also located in the same directory.

## Binary Model 🔬

The corresponding code can be found in the notebook **`binary_model.ipynb`**. Pre-saved weights of the trained model are available in the **`model_weights`** folder.
